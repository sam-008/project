	<p>We have taken a completely new turn for blooming up the education system by striving for excellence in every possible field and achieving it in a spectacular way. Our motto “Education – Your Door To The Future” not only goes with rigorous scholastic programmers but also, we seek to develop and nurture the different facets of a child. A committed and supportive management, dedicated teachers, caring and co-operative parents blend harmoniously to create a child- centric school and through collaborative efforts we can achieve more to benefit our students who are the future leaders of tomorrow.<BR><BR>


SHREE MAHENDRA tends to go to every extent to achieve holistic development of our children where we guide students to develop capacities, acquire knowledge and virtues and provide service. We are on a path of building an ideal structure for education, liberal ideas and atonement in Science and Technology which would prove best for our future generations. We try to encourage our children to unleash their fullest potential.<br><br>
We also believe that every child is unique in nature with varying needs. Therefore, by fostering a conductive environment full of love, care and creativity we instill in our children a desire to learn with emphasis on their social, emotional, physical, aesthetic and intellectual developmental aspects.<br><br>
Our aim is to work unanimously to unleash the inherent intellectual, social and emotional capacities of all students who pass through the gate of this Institution as we strongly believe in “Vision with a dream” concept which is aptly said:<br>
“Vision without Action…Is Just a Dream<br>
Action without Vision…Just Passes the Time<br>
But, Vision and Action…Can Change the World”<br>
